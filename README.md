Oracle Scripts (morning checks and other vaguely useful stuff)

Please check AmChecks.docx for info on how to install and use these scripts. READ_ME.txt should have some useful stuff in in too. Maybe.
It's worth repeating here that you use these scripts at your own peril. These scripts are free and as they say 'you get what you pay for'.

Actually you might find one or more of them useful. If you do please let me know!

I'm moving away from Oracle and scripting so I'm looking for someone who is keen to adopt these scripts and continue to maintain and improve them. If you fancy it let me know. 

Cheers

Tony
